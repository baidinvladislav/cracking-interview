# Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
# Output: 6
# Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
# Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
#
# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
# Output: 10
# Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
# Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.


class Solution:
    def longestOnes(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        left = 0
        zeroes = 0
        result = 0
        for right in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[right] == 0:
                zeroes += 1

            while zeroes > k:
                if nums[left] == 0:
                    zeroes -= 1
                left += 1

            result = max(result, right - left + 1)

        return result
