## On Arrays

Binary search is a common optimization to a linear scan when searching for an element's index or insertion point 
if it doesn't exist. In these problems, left and right represent the bounds of the subarray we are currently considering. 
mid represents the index of the middle of the current search space. Sometimes, 
you will directly be binary searching for the answer. Other times, 
binary search will just be a tool that speeds up your algorithm. Let's look at some examples.

<h3>704. Binary Search</h3>
You are given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target. 
If target exists in nums, return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

We'll start with a simple example to show the code implementation. 
The brute force solution would be to perform a linear scan - just check every index. This runs in O(n), 
where n is the length of the input array. Because the array is sorted, 
we can use binary search to improve the time complexity to O(log n).

We don't use any extra space except for a few integer variables.

```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left <= right:
            middle = (left + right) // 2
            if nums[middle] == target:
                return middle
            elif nums[middle] < target:
                left = middle + 1
            elif nums[middle] > target:
                right = middle - 1
        return -1
```

<h3>Example 2: 74. Search a 2D Matrix</h3>
Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value target in an m x n integer matrix matrix. 
Integers in each row are sorted from left to right. The first integer of each row is greater 
than the last integer of the previous row.
