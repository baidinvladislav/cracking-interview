## Example greedy problems

<h3>Example 1: 2126. Destroying Asteroids</h3>
You are given an integer array asteroids and an integer mass representing the mass of a planet. 
The planet will collide with the asteroids one by one - you can choose the order. If the mass of the planet is less 
than the mass of an asteroid, the planet is destroyed. Otherwise, the planet gains the mass of the asteroid. 
Can you destroy all the asteroids?

We need to choose the optimal order in which the planet collides with the asteroids. Let's say that at the start, 
only two asteroids have a mass less than or equal to the planet, x and y, where x < y < planet. 
Which should we choose to collide first? The answer is that it doesn't matter. Because our mass can only increase, 
if at any point we can destroy an asteroid, we will always be able to destroy that asteroid in the future. 
What's the easiest way to figure out what asteroids we can take at any given step?

To maintain the asteroids that we can destroy, we can sort the input and iterate through it. Then, 
we can just greedily choose the asteroid with the smallest mass at each step. If at any step, 
the smallest remaining asteroid has a mass greater than our planet, then destroying all asteroids is impossible 
and no order of asteroids would allow us to continue.

Although there could be many strategies that lead to a correct solution, 
greedily choosing the smallest remaining asteroid at every step is an intuitive and easy to implement strategy.

```python
class Solution:
    def asteroidsDestroyed(self, mass: int, asteroids: List[int]) -> bool:
        asteroids.sort()
        for asteroid in asteroids:
            if asteroid > mass:
                return False
            mass += asteroid
        
        return True
```

As you can see, after realizing that greedily choosing the smallest asteroid is the optimal method, 
implementing the algorithm is very simple. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(nâ‹…logn) due to the sort, 
where n is the number of asteroids. The amount of space used is dependent on the language you are using. For example, 
Python implements timsort which uses up to O(n) space, but a language that uses quicksort uses O(logn) space.
