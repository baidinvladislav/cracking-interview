<h1>Design of a Monitoring System</h1>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
Let’s sum up what we want our monitoring system to do for us:
* Monitor critical local processes on a server for crashes.
* Monitor any anomalies in the use of CPU/memory/disk/network bandwidth by a process on a server.
* Monitor overall server health, such as CPU, memory, disk, network bandwidth, average load, and so on.
* Monitor hardware component faults on a server, such as memory failures, failing or slowing disk, and so on.
* Monitor the server’s ability to reach out-of-server critical services, such as network file systems and so on.
* Monitor all network switches, load balancers, and any other specialized hardware inside a data center.
* Monitor power consumption at the server, rack, and data center levels.
* Monitor any power events on the servers, racks, and data center.
* Monitor routing information and DNS for external clients.
* Monitor network links and paths’ latency inside and across the data centers.
* Monitor network status at the peering points.
* Monitor overall service health that might span multiple data centers—for example, a CDN and its performance.

<h2>Building block we will use</h2>
The design of distributed monitoring will consist of the following building block:
Blob storage: We’ll use blob storage to store our information about metrics.

<h2>High-level design</h2>
The high-level components of our monitoring service are the following:
* Storage: A time-series database stores metrics data, such as the current CPU use or the number 
of exceptions in an application.
* Data collector service: This fetches the relevant data from each service and saves it in the storage.
* Querying service: This is an API that can query on the time-series database and return the relevant information.
